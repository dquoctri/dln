User table: This table stores the user's basic information, such as username, email address, password, first name, last name, and any other relevant information.

Role table: This table stores the user's role, such as admin, customer, or vendor.

User Role table: This table associates a user with a role.

Address table: This table stores the user's address information, such as street, city, state, and zip code.

Order table: This table stores the user's order history.

Payment table: This table stores the user's payment information, such as credit card details.


Some of the APIs that can be included in the user service are:

Registration API: This API allows a user to register for an account.

Login API: This API allows a user to log in to their account.

Profile API: This API allows a user to view and edit their profile information.

Address API: This API allows a user to manage their address information.

Order API: This API allows a user to view their order history and current order status.

Payment API: This API allows a user to manage their payment information.

Password reset API: This API allows a user to reset their password if they forget it.

Authorization API: This API allows an administrator to manage the roles and permissions of users in the system.

Here are some sample REST API URLs for implementing authentication with access token and refresh token:

POST /auth/login: This API endpoint is used to log in a user and obtain an access token and a refresh token.
POST /auth/refresh: This API endpoint is used to obtain a new access token using a refresh token.
POST /auth/logout: This API endpoint is used to log out a user and revoke their access and refresh tokens.
Depending on your application's requirements, you may also need additional API endpoints, such as:

POST /auth/register: This API endpoint is used to create a new user account.
POST /auth/forgot-password: This API endpoint is used to initiate the password reset process.
POST /auth/reset-password: This API endpoint is used to reset a user's password.

Sure! Here's an example of how you might structure a database for an authentication API using PostgreSQL:

/register - This API endpoint allows a user to register a new account.
/login - This API endpoint allows a user to authenticate and create a new session (which generates access and refresh tokens).
/refresh - This API endpoint allows a user to refresh an expired access token using a valid refresh token.
/logout - This API endpoint allows a user to revoke their current refresh token (which will invalidate any associated access tokens).
/change-password - This API endpoint allows a user to change their password.
/forgot-password - This API endpoint allows a user to request a password reset link via email.
Of course, the specifics of your authentication API will depend on your requirements, but hopefully this gives you a good starting point.
